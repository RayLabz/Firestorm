# Firestorm for Flutter: API Guide

This guide provides an overview of the Firestorm for Flutter API, including its key components and how to use them.

## Introduction
Firestorm for Flutter is a powerful library that provides a unified API for working with both Firestore and Realtime Database in Dart/Flutter applications.
