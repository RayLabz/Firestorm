## Initialization
To use the Firestorm Realtime Database API, you need to initialize it first using `RDB.init()`.
This registers your classes for serialization/deserialization and provides static safety checks.
```dart
await RDB.init();
```

> [!NOTE]
> This operation is asynchronous and should be called before using any other Firestorm API methods.
> It is recommended to call this in the `main()` function of your app, before running any other code.

Alternatively, you can initialize Firestorm with a custom `FirebaseOptions` configuration:
```dart
await RDB.init(options);
```

## Basic Operations

> [!CAUTION]
> A lot of operations are asynchronous and return `Future<?>`. In these cases, you may choose
> whether to `await` _(blocking)_ the operation, use then `then` or `catchError` _(non-blocking)_,
> or ignore the result entirely.

### Creating objects

#### Single object using `create.one()`:
```dart
await RDB.create.one(person);
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `create.many()`:
```dart
await RDB.create.many(people);
```

### Getting objects
#### Single object using `get.one()`:
```dart
Person person = await RDB.get.one<Person>("person-id");
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `get.many()`:
```dart
List<Person> people = await RDB.get.many<Person>(["person-id-1", "person-id-2"]);
```

[Back to contents](#contents)

---

### Updating objects
#### Single object using `update.one()`:
```dart
await RDB.update.one(person);
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `update.many()`:
```dart
await RDB.update.many(people);
```

### Deleting objects
#### Single object using `delete.one()`:
```dart
await RDB.delete.one(person);
```

#### Single object using its ID with `delete.oneWithID()`:
```dart
await RDB.delete.oneWithID(Person, "person-id");
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `delete.many()`:
```dart
await RDB.delete.many(people);
```

#### Many objects using their ID with `delete.manyWithID()`:
```dart
await RDB.delete.manyWithID(Person, ["person-id-1", "person-id-2"]);
```

#### All objects of a type using `delete.all()`:
```dart
await RDB.delete.all(Person, iAmSure: true);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `iAmSure: true` parameter is required to prevent accidental deletion of all objects of a type.

### Listing objects

#### Up to 10 objects of a type using `list.ofClass()`:
```dart
List<Person> people = await RDB.list.ofClass<Person>();
```

#### With optional custom limit:
```dart
List<Person> people = await RDB.list.ofClass<Person>(limit: 5);
```

#### All objects of a type using `list.allOfClass()`:
```dart
List<Person> people = await RDB.list.allOfClass<Person>();
```

### Checking existence of objects

#### Single object using `exists.one()`:
```dart
bool exists = await RDB.exists.one<Person>(person);
```

#### Single object using its ID `exists.oneWithID()`:
```dart
bool exists = await RDB.exists.oneWithID(Person, "person-id");
```

## Queries & Filtering

### Query examples

#### Basic query to filter objects by a field value:

```dart
//Query:
RDBQueryResult<Person> result = await RDB.list.filter<Person>(Person)
        .equalTo(30, field: 'age')
        .fetch();

//Obtain result:
List<Person> people = result.items;
```

#### Query with multiple conditions:

```dart
//Query:
RDBQueryResult<Person> result = await RDB.list.filter<Person>(Person)
        .equalTo(30, field: 'age')
        .equalTo(1.70, field: 'height')
        .orderByChild("age")
        .fetch();

//Obtain result:
List<Person> people = result.items;
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can chain multiple query functions to build complex queries.

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting/ordering queries are only supported for fields that are indexed in the Realtime Database.
> If you encounter an error about missing indexes, you can create the required index in the Realtime Database console.
> For more information, refer to the [Realtime Database documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/flutter/structure-data#data_indexing).

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting functions such as `orderByChild()` must be used before `limitToFirst()`, `limitToLast()`, and after any `equal` clauses.

### Query functions reference
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `equalTo(value, {String? field})` | Filters objects where the specified field is equal to the given value. |
| `orderByChild(String field)` | Orders the results by the specified child field. |
| `orderByKey()` | Orders the results by the key of the objects. |
| `orderByValue()` | Orders the results by the value of the objects. |
| `limitToFirst(int limit)` | Limits the results to the first `limit` number of objects. |
| `limitToLast(int limit)` | Limits the results to the last `limit` number of objects. |
| `startAt(value, {String? field})` | Starts the results at the specified value for the given field. |
| `endAt(value, {String? field})` | Ends the results at the specified value for the given field. |
| `fetch()` | Executes the query and returns the results as a `RDBQueryResult<T>`. |

## Real-time Listeners

### Listen to a single object:
```dart
RDB.listen.toObject<Person>(
  person, 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

### Listen to a list of objects:
```dart
RDB.listen.toObjects<Person>(
  people, 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

### Listen to an object using its ID:
```dart
RDB.listen.toID<Person>(
  Person, "person-id", 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

### Listen to a list of objects using IDs:
```dart
RDB.listen.toIDs<ComputingStudent>(
  ComputingStudent, ["person1-id", "person2-id"], 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

## Subcollections

You can access subcollections using the `subcollection` attribute, which is available for most calls:

### Example: Creating an object in a subcollection
```dart
await RDB.create.one(person, subcollection: "friends");
```

### Example: Getting an object from a subcollection
```dart
Person person = await RDB.get.one<Person>("person-id", subcollection: "friends");
```

**Firestorm offers a way to access subcollections in a variety of other methods.**

> [!NOTE]
> Subcollections are useful for organizing related data as part of a specific class.
> They can be used as an alternative to indexing or filtering data, to provide a quicker
> way to access related objects without needing to perform complex queries.

## Pagination

> [!NOTE]
> Pagination is not supported by Firestorm's RDB API in the current version. It is planned for a future release.

## References

You can create references to objects or entire classes using the `RDB.reference` method.
This returns a traditional Firestore reference that can be used to access the object or class.

### Reference to single document with class and ID
```dart
DatabaseReference reference = RDB.reference.documentFromID(RDB.constructPathForClassAndID(Person, ["person-id"]));
```

### Reference to single document with object
```dart
DatabaseReference reference = RDB.reference.documentFromObject(person);
```

### Reference to a single document with path
```dart
DatabaseReference reference = RDB.reference.documentFromPath("Person/person-id");
```

### Reference to a collection with class
```dart
DatabaseReference reference = RDB.reference.collection(Person);
```

## Configuration options
Firestorm provides several configuration options to customize its behavior.

### Caching
You can enable or disable caching for Realtime Database operations using `RDB.enableCaching()` or `RDB.disableCaching()`:
```dart
RDB.enableCaching(); // Enable caching
```

```dart
RDB.disableCaching(); // Disable caching
```

### Using the emulator
You can use the Realtime Database emulator for local development and testing using `RDB.useEmulator()`:
When using the emulator, you need to call this function after initializing Firestorm's RDB object
and before calling any other functions.

```dart
RDB.useEmulator("localhost", 9000); // Use the Realtime Database emulator
```

### Shutting down the Realtime Database instance
You can shut down the Realtime Database instance using `RDB.shutdown()`:
```dart
await RDB.shutdown(); // Shut down the RDB instance
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is useful for cleaning up resources when your app is closed or when you no longer need to use the Realtime Database.
> It is recommended to call this method when your app is closed or when you no longer need to use Realtime Database.
> This will close all open connections and release resources used by the Realtime Database.

> [!WARNING]
> You can also use this method to reset the Realtime Database instance and start fresh, by recalling `RDB.init()`.
> You will not be able to use any Realtime Database methods after calling `RDB.shutdown()` until you call `RDB.init()` again.

## Using the Realtime Database API
For total control over the Realtime Database for other types of operations, you can use the traditional Firestore API methods directly by using the `RDB.instance` property.
```dart
FirebaseFirestore firestore = RDB.instance;
//TODO - Use the Firestore instance as needed
```
