## Initialization
To use the Firestorm Firestore API, you need to initialize it first using `FS.init()`.
This registers your classes for serialization/deserialization and provides static safety checks.
```dart
await FS.init();
```

> [!NOTE]
> This operation is asynchronous and should be called before using any other Firestorm API methods.
> It is recommended to call this in the `main()` function of your app, before running any other code.

Alternatively, you can initialize Firestorm with a custom `FirebaseOptions` configuration:
```dart
await FS.init(options);
```

## Basic Operations

> [!CAUTION]
> A lot of operations are asynchronous and return `Future<?>`. In these cases, you may choose
> whether to `await` _(blocking)_ the operation, use then `then` or `catchError` _(non-blocking)_,
> or ignore the result entirely.

### Creating objects

#### Single object using `create.one()`:
```dart
await FS.create.one(person);
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `create.many()`:
```dart
await FS.create.many(people);
```

[Back to contents](#contents)

---

### Getting objects
#### Single object using `get.one()`:
```dart
Person person = await FS.get.one<Person>("person-id");
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `get.many()`:
```dart
List<Person> people = await FS.get.many<Person>(["person-id-1", "person-id-2"]);
```

[Back to contents](#contents)

---

### Updating objects
#### Single object using `update.one()`:
```dart
await FS.update.one(person);
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `update.many()`:
```dart
await FS.update.many(people);
```

[Back to contents](#contents)

---

### Deleting objects
#### Single object using `delete.one()`:
```dart
await FS.delete.one(person);
```

#### Single object using its ID with `delete.oneWithID()`:
```dart
await FS.delete.oneWithID(Person, "person-id");
```

#### Multiple objects (list) using `delete.many()`:
```dart
await FS.delete.many(people);
```

#### Many objects using their ID with `delete.manyWithID()`:
```dart
await FS.delete.manyWithID(Person, ["person-id-1", "person-id-2"]);
```

#### All objects of a type using `delete.all()`:
```dart
await FS.delete.all(Person, iAmSure: true);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `iAmSure: true` parameter is required to prevent accidental deletion of all objects of a type.

### Listing objects

#### Up to 10 objects of a type using `list.ofClass()`:
```dart
List<Person> people = await FS.list.ofClass<Person>();
```

#### With optional custom limit:
```dart
List<Person> people = await FS.list.ofClass<Person>(limit: 5);
```

#### All objects of a type using `list.allOfClass()`:
```dart
List<Person> people = await FS.list.allOfClass<Person>();
```

### Checking existence of objects

#### Single object using `exists.one()`:
```dart
bool exists = await FS.exists.one<Person>(person);
```

#### Single object using its ID `exists.oneWithID()`:
```dart
bool exists = await FS.exists.oneWithID(Person, "person-id");
```

## Queries & Filtering

### Query examples

#### Basic query to filter objects by a field value:

```dart
//Query:
FSQueryResult<Person> result = await FS.list.filter<Person>(Person)
        .whereGreaterThanOrEqualTo("age", 18)
        .fetch();

//Obtain result:
List<Person> filteredPeople = result.items;
```

#### Query with multiple conditions:

```dart
//Query:
FSQueryResult<Person> result = await FS.list.filter<Person>(Person)
        .whereEqualTo("city", "New York")
        .orderBy("name", descending: true)
        .limit(10)
        .fetch();
//Obtain result:
List<Person> filteredPeople = result.items;
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can chain multiple query functions to build complex queries.

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting/ordering queries are only supported for fields that are indexed in Firestore.
> If you encounter an error about missing indexes, you can create the required index in the Firestore console.
> You can find more information about creating indexes in the [Firestore documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/indexing).

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting functions such as `orderBy` must be used before `limit`, `startAt`, `endAt`, etc.' and after any `where` clauses.

### Query functions reference

## Transactions

#### Simple transaction example
You can execute a transaction using the `FS.transaction.run()` method.

```dart
  FS.transaction.run((transaction) async {
    Person? p =  await transaction.get.one<Person>(person.id);
    if (p == null) {
      print("Person not found"); //TODO - Error handling logic?
      return;
    }
    
    p.age = 20;
    transaction.update.one(p);
  });
```

> [!NOTE]
> Transactions are useful for performing multiple read and write operations atomically.
> If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
> You can use transactions to ensure data consistency, especially when multiple users might be updating the same data concurrently.

> [!NOTE]
> In a transaction, you can use the `transaction.get.one()` method to read a document, and then use `transaction.update.one()` or `transaction.create.one()` to modify/create. 
> You can also use `transaction.delete.one()` to delete a document.
> You cannot use the regular `FS.get.one()` or `FS.update.one()` methods inside a transaction.

#### Transaction with additional parameters:
You can also pass additional parameters to the transaction, such as `maxAttempts` to control the number of retry
attempts in case of contention, and `timeout` to control the time to wait for it to be completed.

```dart
  FS.transaction.run((transaction) async {
    Person? p =  await transaction.get.one<Person>(person.id);
    if (p == null) {
    print("Person not found"); //TODO - Error handling logic?
    return;
    }
    
    p.age = 20;
    transaction.update.one(p);
  }, maxAttempts: 3, timeout: Duration(seconds: 5)).then((value) {
    print("Transaction completed successfully"); //TODO - Success handling logic?
  }).catchError((error) {
    print("Transaction failed: $error"); //TODO - Error handling logic?
  });
```

## Batch Operations
You can execute batch operations using the `FS.batch.run()` method.
This allows you to perform multiple create, update, and delete operations in a single batch.
Batch operations are useful for optimizing performance and reducing the number of network requests.

```dart
FS.batch.run((batch) async {
  await batch.create.one(purchaseRecord);
  await batch.update.one(customer);
  await batch.delete.one(bookRecord);
});
```

## Real-time Listeners

### Listen to a single object:
```dart
FS.listen.toObject<Person>(
  person, 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

### Listen to a list of objects:
```dart
FS.listen.toObjects<Person>(
  people, 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

### Listen to an object using its ID:
```dart
FS.listen.toID<Person>(
  Person, "person-id", 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

### Listen to a list of objects using IDs:
```dart
FS.listen.toIDs<ComputingStudent>(
  ComputingStudent, ["person1-id", "person2-id"], 
  onCreate: (object) {
    print("Created: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onChange: (object) {
    print("Changed: ${object.id}"); //TODO
  },
  onDelete: () {
    print("Deleted"); //TODO
  }
);
```

## Subcollections

You can access subcollections using the `subcollection` attribute, which is available for most calls:

### Example: Creating an object in a subcollection
```dart
await FS.create.one(person, subcollection: "friends");
```

### Example: Getting an object from a subcollection
```dart
Person person = await FS.get.one<Person>("person-id", subcollection: "friends");
```

**Firestorm offers a way to access subcollections in a variety of other methods.**

> [!NOTE]
> Subcollections are useful for organizing related data as part of a specific class.
> They can be used as an alternative to indexing or filtering data, to provide a quicker 
> way to access related objects without needing to perform complex queries.

## Pagination
You can paginate results using the `FS.paginate()` method:
```dart
//Create a paginator:
FSPaginator<Person> paginator = FS.paginate<Person>();

// Fetch the first page of results and print them:
FSQueryResult<Person> page1 = await paginator.next();
print("Page 1:");
page1.items.forEach((person) {
  print("Person ID: ${person.id}, Name: ${person.name}");
});

// Fetch the next page of results and print them:
FSQueryResult<Person> page2 = await paginator.next();
print("Page 2:");
page2.items.forEach((person) {
  print("Person ID: ${person.id}, Name: ${person.name}");
});

//etc...
```

You can use a custom number of results to retrieve for pagination:
```dart
FSPaginator<Person> paginator = FS.paginate<Person>(limit: 20);
//...
```

You can also set the starting point for pagination using a document ID:
```dart
FSPaginator<Person> paginator = FS.paginate<Person>(lastDocumentID: "some-document-id");
//...
```

## References

You can create references to objects or entire classes using the `FS.reference` method.
This returns a traditional Firestore reference that can be used to access the object or class.

### Reference to single document with class and ID
```dart
DocumentReference<Map<String, dynamic>> reference = FS.reference.documentFromID(Person, "person-id");
```

### Reference to single document with object
```dart
DocumentReference<Map<String, dynamic>> reference = FS.reference.documentFromObject(person);
```

### Reference to a single document with path
```dart
DocumentReference<Map<String, dynamic>> reference = FS.reference.documentFromPath("Person/person-id");
```

### Reference to a collection with class
```dart
CollectionReference reference = FS.reference.collection(ComputingStudent);
```

## Configuration options
Firestorm provides several configuration options to customize its behavior.

### Caching
You can enable or disable caching for Firestore operations using `FS.enableCaching()` or `FS.disableCaching()`:
```dart
FS.enableCaching(); // Enable caching
```

```dart
FS.disableCaching(); // Disable caching
```

### Online/Offline persistence
You can enable or disable online/offline persistence using `FS.enableNetwork()` or `FS.disableNetwork()`:
```dart
FS.enableNetwork(); // Enable online/offline persistence
```

```dart
FS.disableNetwork(); // Disable online/offline persistence
```

### Using the emulator
You can use the Firestore emulator for local development and testing using `FS.useEmulator()`:
When using the emulator, you need to call this function after initializing Firestorm's FS object 
and before calling any other functions.

```dart
FS.useEmulator("localhost", 8080); // Use the emulator at localhost:8080
```

### Shutting down the Firestore instance
You can shut down the Firestore instance using `FS.shutdown()`:
```dart
await FS.shutdown(); // Shut down the Firestore instance
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is useful for cleaning up resources when your app is closed or when you no longer need to use Firestore.
> It is recommended to call this method when your app is closed or when you no longer need to use Firestore.
> This will close all open connections and release resources used by Firestore.

> [!WARNING]
> You can also use this method to reset the Firestore instance and start fresh, by recalling `FS.init()`.
> You will not be able to use any Firestore methods after calling `FS.shutdown()` until you call `FS.init()` again.

## Using the Firestore API
For total control over the Firestore for other types of operations, you can use the traditional Firestore API methods directly by using the `FS.instance` property.
```dart
FirebaseFirestore firestore = FS.instance;
//TODO - Use the Firestore instance as needed
```
