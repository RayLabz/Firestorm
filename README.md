# Firestorm
An object-oriented data access API for Google's Firestore.

Firestorm is an object-oriented data access API for Google's Firestore. It enables developers to rapidly develop 
applications that utilize Firestore's capabilities by interacting with it in an object-oriented way. Firestorm uses
 standardized functions and complements the full flexibility of Google's Firestore API. It organizes classes as Firestore
  collections and objects of these classes as documents in these collections. Most importantly, it aims to reduce code, 
  improve its readability and support rapid application development.
